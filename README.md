- 👋 Hi, I’m @DMJack92
- 👀 I’m interested in testing already made programs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various scripting related programs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python code projects, Godot projects, or Unreal Engine projects.
- 📫 How to reach me, not by phone because it will go straight to voicemail.
- 😄 Pronouns: I prefer he, but whatever floats your boat.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am not a zombie or an android. I do, however, have a lot of pets that are not cats and dogs.
